This repository contains a challenge proposed by "Digital Solutions" to apply for the position of "Frontend Trainee"
This challenge was done with html, sass (css preprocessor), javascript, ajax.

In this case I decided not to use javascript frameworks (such as Vue, React, etc) because I consider that the project would be too heavy for the requirements they request.

To view this project on your computer, you just need to download it. It does not require having anything installed.
